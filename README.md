### Hi there 👋, my name is Xinshuo Weng. 

I am a Ph.D. candidate (2018-) at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) advised by Kris Kitani and also a research intern at the NVIDIA Autonomous Vehicle Research group advised by Marco Pavone. I received masters (2016-17) at CMU, where I worked with Yaser Sheikh and Kris Kitani. Prior to CMU, I worked at Facebook Reality Lab as a research engineer to help build “Photorealistic Telepresence”. My bachelor was received from Wuhan University. My research interest lies in 3D computer vision for perception and prediction in autonomous systems. I have developed 3D multi-object tracking systems such as AB3DMOT that received >1,200 stars. Also, I am leading a few autonomous driving workshops at major conferences such as NeurIPS 2021, IJCAI 2021, ICCV 2021 and IROS 2021. I was awarded a Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship for 2020 and a Facebook Fellowship Finalist for 2021.
