### Hi there 👋, my name is Xinshuo Weng. 

I am a Ph.D. student (2018-) at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) advised by Kris Kitani and also currently a research intern at the NVIDIA Autonomous Vehicle Research group advised by Marco Pavone. I received master's degree (2016-17) at CMU, where I worked with Yaser Sheikh and Kris Kitani. Prior to CMU, I worked at Facebook Reality Lab as a research engineer to help build “Photorealistic Telepresence”. My bachelor was received from Wuhan University. My research interest lies in 3D computer vision and Graph Neural Networks for autonomous systems.
