### Hi there 👋, welcome to Xinshuo Weng's GitHub page!

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University advised by Kris Kitani and also an incoming research scientist at the NVIDIA Autonomous Vehicle Research. I received master's degree (2016-17) at CMU. Prior to CMU, I worked at Facebook Reality Lab as a research engineer to help build “Photorealistic Telepresence”. My bachelor was received from Wuhan University. My research interest lies in generative models and 3D computer vision for autonomous systems. I have developed 3D multi-object tracking systems such as AB3DMOT that received >1,300 stars on GitHub. Also, I am leading a few autonomous driving workshops at top conferences such as NeurIPS 2021, IJCAI 2021, ICCV 2021 and IROS 2021. I was awarded a number of fellowships and nominations such as the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship for 2020 and Facebook Fellowship Finalist for 2021.
